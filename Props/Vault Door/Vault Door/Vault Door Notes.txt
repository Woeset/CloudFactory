 How TO CONNECT OBJECT LINKS.

OBJECT NAME                          LINK TO

Door_main                            Main_Door_Hinge
Turning_wheel01 and 02               Door_main
Bollard 1,2 & 3                      Door_main
Gears_&_Pins (Group)                 Door_main
Glass (Group)                        Door_main

For obj users, realign pivot points of Main_Door_Hinge and Door_main to their hinge counter parts.

Basically if you just want to open the door... group all bolts, gears and pins together and link them to Door_main.
Realign pivot points of Main_Door_Hinge and Door_main so that it opens and that Door_main can pivot from the front centre hinge.
Bollard 1,2 & 3 need to link also to Door_main... but keep them seperated so you can animate them later.

The model can actually be animated further to simulate extra mechanical function... 
each gear and wheel can be rotated, each pin and bollard can be moved in and out of place.

Thank you.
